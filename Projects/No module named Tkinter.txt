You probably need to install it using one of (or something similar to) the following:

sudo apt-get install python3-tk 

sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
I have been using Tkinter for a while now. Why don't you try this and let me know if it worked?

try:
    # for Python2
    from Tkinter import *   ## notice capitalized T in Tkinter 
except ImportError:
    # for Python3
    from tkinter import *   ## notice lowercase 't' in tkinter here
Here is the reference link and here is the doc

Better to check versions as suggested here:

if sys.version_info[0] == 3:
    # for Python3
    from tkinter import *   ## notice lowercase 't' in tkinter here
else:
    # for Python2
    from Tkinter import *   ## notice capitalized T in Tkinter
Or you will get error ImportError: No module named tkinter

EDIT 1: Just to make this answer more generic I borrowed the following from the comments. On Fedora please use either of the following commands

sudo dnf install python3-tkinter-3.6.6-1.fc28.x86_64
or

sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
